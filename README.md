# CS576-Tetris-Sample

1. Clone this repo
2. Open it in a 2021 version of Unity
3. 2xClick TetrisScene (in Assets/Scenes)
4. Hit run?

Apologies for the mess. YMMV.

AHGGGGG just realized my push did not work lol. sorry.


I just added more moves for the AI to a point it seems to result in slightly better CPU.
Otherwise, I honestly did not do mcuh.
